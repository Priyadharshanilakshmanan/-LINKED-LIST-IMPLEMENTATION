DESCRIBTION:

Description
This repository contains a C program that implements a singly linked list with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. The program is designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of linked lists, with efficient memory management, modular code structure, and clear function definitions. It's a great resource for learning how linked lists work and for implementing them in C.

Key Operations Supported:
Insertion: Insert nodes at the beginning or at the end of the list.
Deletion: Delete nodes with a specific value.
Traversal: Traverse the list and print the contents.
Features
Insert at Beginning: Adds a new node at the start of the list.
Insert at End: Adds a new node at the end of the list.
Delete Node: Removes a node with a specific value from the list.
Traversal: Prints the contents of the list.
Modular Code: The code is modular with each operation (insertion, deletion, traversal) encapsulated in separate functions for better maintainability and readability.
Requirements
C Compiler: A C compiler such as GCC to compile the source code.
Operating System: Any OS that supports C programming (Linux, Windows, macOS).
Installation
Step 1: Clone the repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/singly-linked-list-c.git
cd singly-linked-list-c
Step 2: Compile the program
You can compile the C program using the gcc compiler:

bash
Copy
gcc -o linked_list linked_list.c
Step 3: Run the program
Execute the compiled program:

bash
Copy
./linked_list
Usage
This program allows you to perform the following linked list operations:

Insert nodes at the beginning:

insertAtBeginning(head, value): Adds a node with the specified value at the start of the list.
Insert nodes at the end:

insertAtEnd(head, value): Adds a node with the specified value at the end of the list.
Delete nodes by value:

deleteNode(head, value): Removes the first node with the specified value from the list.
Traverse the list and print the values:

traverseList(head): Prints all the elements of the linked list from the head to the last node.
Example
c
Copy
#include "linked_list.h"

int main() {
    struct Node *head = NULL;

    // Insert nodes at the beginning
    insertAtBeginning(&head, 10);
    insertAtBeginning(&head, 20);
    insertAtBeginning(&head, 30);

    // Print list contents
    traverseList(head);

    // Insert nodes at the end
    insertAtEnd(&head, 40);
    insertAtEnd(&head, 50);

    // Print list contents again
    traverseList(head);

    // Delete a node
    deleteNode(&head, 20);
    deleteNode(&head, 100); // Try deleting a node that doesn't exist

    // Print list contents again
    traverseList(head);

    return 0;
}
Output Example:
pgsql
Copy
Node with value 10 inserted at the beginning.
Node with value 20 inserted at the beginning.
Node with value 30 inserted at the beginning.
List contents: 30 20 10
Node with value 40 inserted at the end.
Node with value 50 inserted at the end.
List contents: 30 20 10 40 50
Node with value 20 deleted.
Node with value 100 not found.
List contents: 30 10 40 50
